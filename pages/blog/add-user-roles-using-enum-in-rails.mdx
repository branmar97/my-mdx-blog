In this blog post we will learn how to set up user roles by using [enum](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.5/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html). This will allow us to use methods like `.admin?` or `.role` to check user roles. 

It can be used to restrict access to certain views or actions.

Let's get started! 

## Install Devise 

We will use [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) to get our authentication system initialized quickly.

Add `devise` to your Gemfile.

```
gem 'devise'
```

Run `bundle install` in your terminal.

Next, run the generator.

```
rails generate devise:install
```

Add a configuration to `config/environments/development.rb`

```
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```

Now we can create our user model. Add `role:integer` after the model name.

```
rails generate devise User role:integer 
```

By adding `role:integer` to our generator, we skip needing to create a migration and add our role column later. 

Now we have a User model with a role column. We need to edit this column.

Go to your migrations directory and find your Users table migration. 

Change `t.integer :role` to `t.integer :role, :default => 0`

This will set our default role value to 0.

Run `rails db:migrate`.

## Add Enum 

Now that the authentication is set up, we can add [enum](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.5/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html). It will go in the user model.

```
enum role: [:standard, :admin]
```

Just to clarify:

- Role: A column in the users table that stores an integer.
- Enum: Maps the given role values to integers in the database.

Our roles are `[:standard, :admin]` and they are mapped to 0 and 1.

Next, run `rails c` to start the console and create a new user.

```
user = User.create(email: test@test.com, password: password, role: 0)
```

Type `user.role`, and it should return `standard`.

```
user.role 

=> "standard"
```

Thanks for reading my blog post.
